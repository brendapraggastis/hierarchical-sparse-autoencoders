# H-SAE Implementation code
* This is the code for running and training H-SAEs
* `moe_eqx.py` contains the model itself
* `run_moe_eqx.py` orchestrates the training job/checkpointing
* `run_moe_eqx_utils.py` contains utility functions for training/running (e.g. a function to load a checkpointed model)
